**Abstract:** This paper examines whether net operating assets (NOA) predict future stock returns and develops an NOA-based trading strategy. Building on the idea that high NOA reflects balance-sheet expansion and potential overvaluation driven by investors’ overreliance on accounting earnings and managerial discretion, we test cross-sectional return predictability using U.S. equities from 1980–2022. Sorting stocks by market value and NOA, we construct a hedged long–short portfolio that goes long low-NOA firms and short high-NOA firms, and evaluate performance across holding horizons. The strategy delivers economically and statistically significant abnormal returns, with the strongest performance in the mid-cap group and a three-month holding period. Risk-adjusted tests (CAPM and multifactor models) and Fama–MacBeth regressions confirm that NOA remains a robust negative predictor of future returns after controlling for related accrual and investment measures.
